<h1>Chocolate</h1>
<p>Chocolate is made from tropical Theobroma cacao tree seeds. 
Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.
After the European discovery of the Americas, 
chocolate became very popular in the wider world, and its demand exploded.
Chocolate has since become a popular food product that millions enjoy every day,
thanks to its unique, rich, and sweet taste.

    <h1>Pets</h1>
    <p>We feel especially secure with dogs and cats because of the unconditional
       love they provide. "No matter what you do or say, your dog or cat accepts 
       you and is attached to you. Taking care of a dog or a cat can provide a
        sense of purpose and a feeling of validation when you wake up or come home 
        and there's someone who's happy to see you," says Dr. Fricchione.

  <h1>Hiking</h1>
<p>
  	There's nothing quite like an adventure in the mountains, being surrounded 
  by nature's giants. The achievement of reaching the summit, the epic views along
   the way, the feeling of weightlessness as you ski down, the sense of awe as 
   you are immersed amongst the wilderness. The mountains have the ability to 
   conjure up our most primal emotions and feelings.

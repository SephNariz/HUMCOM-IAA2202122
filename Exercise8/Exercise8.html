Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) used to be a prizefighter 
but lost his chance to win a title when heavy, towering robots 
took over the boxing ring. Now working as a small-time promoter,
 Charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters, 
 barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next.
  After hitting rock bottom, Charlie reluctantly teams with his estranged son, 
  Max (Dakota Goyo), to build and 
  train a championship robot for a last shot at redemption.

In 2035, highly intelligent robots fill public service 
positions throughout the world, operating under three rules
 to keep humans safe. Despite his dark history with robotics,
  Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the alleged 
  suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell)
   and believes that a human-like robot (Alan Tudyk) murdered him. 
   With the help of a robot expert (Bridget Moynahan), 
   Spooner discovers a conspiracy that may enslave the human race.

In the near future, a mechanized police force patrols the
 streets and deals with lawbreakers -- but now, the people are
  fighting back. When one police droid is stolen and given new
   programming, he acquires the ability to feel and think for 
   himself. While the robot, dubbed "Chappie (Sharlto Copley),
   " puzzles out human behavior, the authorities begin to see 
   him as a danger to mankind and order; they will stop at nothing
    to ensure that Chappie is the last of his kind.
